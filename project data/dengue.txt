Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus.Dengue is spread by several species of female mosquitoes of the Aedes type.The virus has
five types;infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others.Subsequent infection with a different type
increases the risk of severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.
