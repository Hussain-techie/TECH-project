* fever, which is usually worse in adults than children
* aching muscles
* loss of appetite
* in some cases, a feeling of nausea
After the rash appears, there will be:-
* Rash: Severity varies from a few spots to a rash that covers the whole body.
* Spots: The spots develop in clusters and generally appear on the face, limbs, chest, and stomach. They tend to be small, red, and itchy.
* Blisters: Blisters can develop on the top of the spots. These can become very itchy.
* Clouding: Within about 48 hours, the blisters cloud over and start drying out. A crust develops.
* Healing: Within about 10 days, the crusts fall off on their own.
During the whole cycle, new waves of spots can appear - in such cases, the patient might have different clusters of spots at varying stages of itchiness, dryness, and
crustiness.

Chickenpox generally resolves within a week or two without treatment. There is no cure, but a vaccine can prevent it.

A doctor may prescribeTrusted Source medication or advise on how to reduce symptoms of itchiness and discomfort, and also on how to prevent the infection from 
spreading to other people.

* Pain or fever:-Tylenol (acetaminophen), which is available to purchase online, may help with symptoms of high temperature and pain. It is important to follow the 
instructions provided by the manufacturer. Aspirin containing products should NOT be used for chickenpox as this can lead to complications. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 
can be used at any time during pregnancy.
* Avoiding dehydration:- It is important to drink plenty of fluids, preferably water, to prevent dehydration. Some doctors recommend sugar-free popsicles or Pedialyte 
for children who are not drinking enough.
* Mouth soreness:-Sugar-free popsicles help ease symptoms of soreness if there are spots in the mouth. Salty or spicy foods should be avoided. If chewing is painful, 
soup might be a good option, but it should not be too hot.
* Itchiness:-ltchiness can become severe, but it is important to minimize scratching to reduce the risk of scarring.
