| MALARIA |
-----------
Malaria is a life-threatening mosquito-borne blood disease. The Anopheles mosquito transmits it to humans.The parasites in mosquitos that spread malaria belong to the
Plasmodium genus. Over 100Trusted Source types of Plasmodium parasite can infect a variety of species.Different types replicate at different rates, changing how 
quickly the symptoms escalate, and the severity of the disease.Once an infected mosquito bites a human, the parasites multiply in the host's liver before infecting and 
destroying red blood cells.

|SYMPTOMS|
----------
In uncomplicated malaria, symptoms progress as follows, through cold, hot, and sweating stages:

* A sensation of cold with shivering
* fever, headaches, and vomiting
* seizures sometimes occur in younger people with the disease
* sweats, followed by a return to normal temperature, with tiredness

|TREATMENT|
-----------
* Treatment aims to eliminate the Plasmodium parasite from the bloodstream.
* Those without symptoms may be treated for infection to reduce the risk of disease transmission in the surrounding population.
* The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) to treat uncomplicated malaria.
* Artemisinin is derived from the plant Artemisia annua, better known as sweet wormwood. It rapidly reduces the concentration of Plasmodium parasites in bloodstream.
* Practitioners often combine ACT with a partner drug. ACT aims to reduce the number of parasites within the first 3 days of infection, while the partner drug
 eliminate the rest.
* Expanding access to ACT treatment worldwide has helped reduce the impact of malaria, but the disease is becoming increasingly resistant to the effects of ACT.
* In places where malaria is resistant to ACT, treatment must contain an effective partner drug.
* The WHO has warned that no alternatives to artemisinin are likely to become available for several years.

|PREVENTION|
------------
* find out what the risk of malaria is in the country and city or region they are visiting
* ask their doctor what medications they should use to prevent infection in that region
* obtain antimalarial drugs before leaving home, to avoid the risk of buying counterfeit drugs while abroad
* consider the risk for individual travelers, including children, older people, pregnant women, and the existing medical conditions of any travelers
